	    <simpara>All FAP projects are about using structured system as the means of creating big models. Structured system philosophy is very simple:
		there are a number of agents that can be combined according to the topology. The topology connects the agents according to that required for the created model.</simpara>
	    <simpara>The structured sytem creates topology basing on system principles: the big model is separated to smaller parts,
		these parts are also separated etc. So the topology is "hidden" in the clear and well understandable structure.</simpara>
	    <simpara>So the model is created via the creation of proper topology of the given set of pre-defined compoments.</simpara>
	    <simpara>There are a number of models types suitable for such model creation apporach. One of the types is <xref linkend="gls_deds"/> that allows creating
		complex dynamic systems.</simpara>

    <sect1 id="ds_nn"><title>Native net</title>
	<sect2><title>Intro</title>
	    <sect3><title>What is native net?</title>
		<simpara>Native net is the initial topology and environment that allows to create the systems using system (model) creation language.
		    So native net is the "sceleton" of the model. Native net allows to manage all units of the model.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Institutionalize all the relation on native layer.</title>
		<simpara>The main idea of native net is to support all relations on the native layer via common design approach, common mechanism. Saing "on
		    native layer" we mean the relations that are not seen from the top layer model, for instance the relations created via iface resoluion, 
		    notifications etc.. In fap2 different approaches are used for establishing such relations.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Distributed env support by native net.</title>
		<simpara>Native net supports interactions between units. Theas mean that these interactions shall correctly work in distributed env. So all
		    ifaces created relations in native net shall be MIface.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	</sect2>
	<sect2><title>What is difference between native and system level connections?</title>
	    <simpara>Native connection allows creating native net, the connection is like "owner-component", "iface_requetor-iface_provider". System level
		connection is just abstraction of system topology. In fap2 the only base mechanism of MVert-MVert binding is used.
		This connection is to utilize interactions between specialilzed units. The behaviour of such 
		connection is defined via this specifics of connected units.</simpara>
	    <simpara>Parameters of system level connectins are defined via system creaton spec (specifying in terms of system creation language).</simpara>

	<sect2><title>Interface vs connections</title>
	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>In fap2 the "atom" of C++ objects interactions is interface, that according to OOP philosophy. However as we see the most of interactions
		    are of 2-ways. The abstraction of 2-ways relation is connection, that covers two interacting interfaces and binding mechanism. Seems the connections
		    can play the role of "atom" when 2-ways interactions.</simpara>
		<simpara>This is also applicable for the interactions in the system layer over native net. Currently the ifaces are resolved over native net. Probably
		    it makes sense to resolve connection points instead.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Do we need "connecting" iface?</title>
		<simpara>The possible design solution is MIface is extended to introduce connection functions, ref MCIface or MCIface2 in 74ed7dd2. The rationale
		    of such design is that iface can be obtain using the current iface resolution  or local iface providing mechanisms,
		    so as iface supports connection we can connect it. The emotions promoting this desing was "What? Why we need now two abstractions to be taken care -
		    iface and connpoint. Let's have just one."</simpara>
		<simpara>This desing is not clear actually. The iface resolution itself involves connections. As for local iface providing, the specific API can 
		    be addd to access conn points.</simpara>
		<simpara>The idea is: connection is just means of accessing and managing iface. They are not same level abstractions.</simpara>

	<sect2><title>How to implement native connection?</title>
	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<sect4><title>Native connection point vs 2-ways connection iface.</title>
		    <simpara>First idea was to define specific iface for 2-ways connection (allowes connect, disconnect, access to provided and required
			ifaces). That was like this:</simpara>
		    <programlisting>
			template &lt;class TPif, class TRif&gt; class MNcpp
			{
			public:
			    using TPair = MNcpp&lt;TRif, TPif&gt;;
			virtual TPif* provided() = 0;
			virtual bool connect(TPair* aPair) = 0;
			virtual bool disconnect(TPair* aPair) = 0;
			virtual bool attach(TPair* aPair) = 0;
			virtual bool deattach(TPair* aPair) = 0;
			virtual bool isConnected(TPair* aPair) const = 0;
			virtual bool getId(string&amp; aId) const = 0;
			};
		    </programlisting>
		    <simpara>but then trying to implements MVert with this and see that it is needed to use MNcpp&lt;MVert, MVert&gt; instead of just MVert when
			connecting. So the question was why cannot we just introduce iface "iface as part of 2-ways connection" and inherit MVert from it but
			not from MIface. These two solution differs in ifaces inheritance stack.</simpara>
		    <simpara>The "Native conn point" approach: MIface - &lt;provided iface&gt; - connection_iface</simpara>
		    <simpara>The "2-ways connection iface":  approach: MIface - connection_iface - &lt;provided iface&gt;</simpara>
		    <simpara>For "Native conn point" approach we can implement native connection point base class that implements connection_iface. Then from this
			class we can inherit custom connpoint implementing (delegating) provided iface. This isolates conn point functionality from 
			host (e.g Unit) implementation,that seems to be advantage. However intuitively this also seems superfluos. For instance MVert already includes the
			methods for 2-ways connection (connect, disconnect etc).</simpara>

	<sect2 id="ds_nn_efcoop"><title>Native hier efficiency comparing to OOP</title>
	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>Lets look at the current FAP systems creation approach. It is based on inheritance, like it is done in OOP.</simpara>
		<simpara>The diff of fap agents and OOP can be seen obviously: in OOP the class keeps the common part of its instances.
		    The instance specific part is the instance context - all the states, whereas the class contains "constant and common" part - methods.</simpara>
		<simpara>If we look at some DES we can see that it also has states and methods (transitions). But in DES transitions is part of instance but
		    not the class (parent). Why?</simpara>
		<simpara>Potentially we can imagine DES following such OOP approach: let's imagine that we can separate all variable part of DES
		    (i.e. all states data). Then the parent DES (i.e. "class") will keep only "constant" part (i.e. structure - states (w.o. states data, 
		    transition etc.). Heirs in that case will use single parent constant part to update its variable part. This would be very efficient - 
		    all heirs would contain only small variable part.</simpara>
		<simpara>Of course the pictue is more complicated that this simple view - the heirs also need to keep another variable data like
		    indication of active/updated etc.</simpara>
		<simpara>Another point that always is eyecatcher: why we need to dupilcate DES controlling part in heirs. For instance fap3-vis containter
	    includes DES SDCs to add vidgets. Thiese SDCs belongs to each instance of container. Obviously this looks superfluous.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Is the structure variable or constant part?</title>
		<simpara>What about structure? It also is represented by variable data like trees data (owned/owning tree, IFR tree, pairs tree etc.).
		    In OOP it is also the part of hier, look for instance to any container, list etc.
		    All regular data in OOP is put to hiers, the only methods or static data is posessed by class.</simpara>
		<simpara>But we face contradiction here: the transitions are defined via the structure (i.e. variable data) so how they can be
		    the essential part of class?</simpara>
		<simpara>The cause of this contradiction is that in FAP the part that is analogue of OOP methods (transitions, states etc)
		    is created via structure (i.e.  variable data) on run-time whereas in OOP it is created via constant definition on compilation time.</simpara>

	<sect2 id="ds_nn_abo"><title>Using auto-indexed arrays for ownership connection instead of name-to-owned_instance mapping</title>
	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>Currently name-to-owned_instance map is used form owning connpoint (specifically NCpOmip, ref Node class def). We can simplify
		    this by using array instead of map. For that we need to keep all owned of the current owning in form of table. So URI in native hier
		    will "internally" be represented by the list of names indexes. Textual representation can be simply formed. Back conversion (from textual repr
		    to index repr seems to be more time consuming but this operation is requred on chromo applying phase only.)</simpara>
		<simpara>Probably, We also need to migrate to the approach "Name as the attribute of the relation" for native hier node local identification,

		<simpara>This is use-case for the case when  "Name as the attribute of the relation" approach is also applied.
		    In this case owning shall have method to get owned name. But it is not enough.
		    Owned can depend on its name (not sure this is a good desing), TrCmpVar for instance, or future constants like SI_23 where the name
		    encodes the constant parameter. Yes, owned can get the name from owning but it also needs to be notified when the name gets changed.</simpara>

		<simpara>Most imprtant native hier node method that ownership relation desing affects is MNode::getNode(GUri). This method is called actively not

	<sect2><title>Intro</title>
	    <simpara>It is common practice to use anonymous units of any type (even native net units). For instance ifaces set obtained via iface resolution
		mechanism consists of anonymous units. However units identification is very important: it gives us essential information of unit that
		helps us in case of debug, analysis etc. Also identification is required to resolve the unit in native net, e.g.
		in case of distributed models. The question is what kind of identification shall be used?</simpara>
	    <simpara>In <xref linkend="gls_fap2"/> the only identificator of unit in native tree is the unit name. So anonymous unit is simply unit with
		hidden name.</simpara>
	</sect2>
	<sect2 id="ds_uinn_id"><title>What units in native net need to have identification.</title>
	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>In <xref linkend="gls_fap2"/> the only ifaces have identification. The focus was to provide native hier creating iface (MUnit) with
		    safe identification mechanism. Other ifaces are identified via MUnit identification plus iface type - so the identifiation scheme is restricted,
		    there is no rule to identify given iface in case of MUnit node includes number of ifaces of same type.
		    Ref <xref linkend="ds_f2dw_isr"/> for the desing weakness description.</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    The question is if we really need to identify all ifaces? The identification require some additional resources.
		    This why in <xref linkend="gls_fap2"/> the exact identification is supported by MUnit only (it supports identification by name and is element of native
			hier, thus can be identified by URI). All other ifaces are "attached" to MUnit so identified via MUnit identification (ref MIface::Mid()).
		</simpara>
		<simpara>Actually identification of ifaces are supported in fap2, ifaces owned MUnit can overload MIface::Uid() to generate unique IDs for each
		    iface (even of same type) but there is mechanism of resolving the iface using this ID. So attempt to have full identification of iface is just
		    attempt of representing iface as unit. Do we really need it? Seems not, because iface is just ptr to virtual func table, so needs the 
		    "carrier" of the iface (i.e. owner of the table).</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Do we need to identify the native units?</title>
		<simpara>Native units provides the means of creating native net. These are native connections, ifaces etc. I cannot see the necessity

			<simpara>It is not enough that the current provider "passes" all potential providers and refresh the tree. It is also required to

			<simpara>Is this approach effective? It is implemented (I stay on ac6c810e11a16f1) but has sowe drowbacks - we need to apply quite complicated schema to 
			    refresh providers tree: when we resolve iface after invalidating current node we need to check if the potential provider already

			    case of invalidating (ref <xref linkend="ds_irm_ut_inv_rb"/>)? Probably the idea was that the valid branches to providers can be re-used.  </simpara>
			<simpara> Seems there is the problem in the current implementation:
			    When the invalidated node is refreshed, it is marked as valid, but when the invalidated providers node is checked on existence
			    then we just omit redirecting to it and it stays invalid. So with this approach we need to check if the node already exists in the path

		    supported? </simpara>
		<simpara>The solution can be as: the agent uses URI with special node "owner", so the navigation goes thru the owner, the client acces the owner

		    an agent and event verify if such agent has rights for access to owner's components.</simpara>

		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			The idea is to introduce "Link" agent that implements "MLink" interface and has content "Managed agent URI". The MLink interface

			Upper node connects Link agent connection point to the corresponding connection point of adapter.
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>
			Hmm, we again faicing same problem - to specify this "subject of link" we need to use content "Subject of link URI", so with navigation

		    <simpara>
			This solution requires some redesign of fap3. Currently MVert iface is "connectable" (is inherited to base iface MCIface) but it assumes

		<simpara>
		    Currently the chromo is the language of mutation of base agent - Elem in FAP2. So it can be applied for any Elem derived agents.
		    In earlier implementation so called "custom mutations" were considered, for instance the mutation "connect". But later "connect" mutation
		    was included in the base mutations set.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    The drawback of this approach is clear - it doesn't allow to utilize the advantage of core FAP desing prinicple "The model is created by
		    mutating agent." (initially root agent). With current approach it is not possible to have optimized mutation language for agent specific mutation.
		    The idea of the current approach was that there shouldn't be specific mutation and that all cases can be simply covered by mutating the base
		    agent (Elem).
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    The question is if there really can be some custom mutations? Seems so. For instance we can constider "transition" agent that 
		    uses compact notations for transition agents, like Add instead of ATrcAddVar.

		    It is common case when required to specify some mutation of newly-created anonymous agent in connection heirarchy with
		    <xref linkend="gls_dmc"/>. New chromo syntax (ref
		    <xref linkend="ds_cli_syntax_ss"/>) allows to do it having two subsequent

		<simpara>
		    This happens when namespace is specified for segment and some node is created within this segment and mutated then.
		    It's clear that the namespace will be propagated to all muts within the segment.
		    Let's look at what will be the root node chromo after <xref linkend="gls_osm"/> transformation.
		    Mut of newly created node the namespace will be "upper" than the target (target is the newly created node). But specifying "upper" node cannot be
		    done via regular URI (that is relative to the target) but via absolute URI only (absolute URI is also prohibited in chromo.)

			Actually segments dont contradict to OSM. It is just the implementation of muts propagation that converts segments to

			So ne need to specify namespace explicitly, i.e. we still have provlem with namespace. So this solution doesn't work.

		<simpara>The main idea is that current chromo is actually a complex tree. For instance: Q arg of connection mut can be 
		simple URI. Or it can be dependent on creation mut (in that case the actual Q arg is P arg of this dependent creation mut). Or
		    it can depend on namespace segment, in that case conn mut Q arg is this namespace segment "namespace" context.</simpara>
		<simpara>So there actual relation between connection mut Q arg and another dependent mut parameter. However in the current
		chromo2 implementation this relation doesn't exists explicitly. The relation is implemented via name (ID); the name is resolved
		    on chromo parsing phase and the relation is set.</simpara>
		<simpara>This approach is quite reasonable. In result of <xref linkend="gls_dmc"/> chromo parsing we get simple <xref linkend="gls_osm"/> chromo
		where the dependencies are resolved via the names (ID) substitution and stated in form of name references in the model native hier.
		So what is the problem here? The problem is that the original chromo and
		parsed chromo has different structure. The ouput chromo can be "reused" but its representation is not convenient.
		    The possible solution is to convert it back to <xref linkend="gls_dmc"/> but this complicates the whole process.</simpara>

		In FAP2 the

		<simpara>
		    DES architecture is based on update-confirm principle: current sytem state is updated (calculated new state value) basing on "freezed"
		    confirmed data. Current DES
		    desing implements the current-new system state via update-confirm pattern. Confirmed data is the current state whereas updated data is new state.
		    This desing is compact and effective in case of updating regular data. But how this pattern can be apply to updating system structure?
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Let's distinguish "system data" and "system structue data". "System data" is the data of system states. "System structure data" is the data
		    representation of system structure. There could be different representation. For instance system chromo is one of them.
		    Obviously it is wrong to update system structure on update phase - this would make the update process not deterministic because the system structure
		    can be changed at any time during update. This would be OK if we had the same solution for system structure data as for system data. System data is 
		    "double buffered" - on update phase updated not state value but buffered one. But this solution hardly possible for system structure data.
		    Updating system structure on confirmation phase is also wrong because the structure update depends on some system data but the data can be
		    change on confirm phase, the double buffering copy is not deterministic here.
		</simpara>

	    <sect3 id="ds_dcs_ucs_cip"><title>Current implementation - a problem.</title>
		<sect4><title>Intro</title>
		    <simpara>
			How the problem with system structure update is solved at the moment (239ba130a63)? Node adapter is used for updating system structure - the update
			performs via system mutation. Adapter performs the mutation ON CONFIRMATION PHASE. It is assumes that the mutation formed by DES depens on system data only
			but not system structure date. So on update phase the system structure is unchanged. But the problem is (!!) with system structure update on confirmation
			phase: the system data on what the mut depends can change during confirmation phase (it depends on the sequence of system states confirmation).
		    </simpara>
		    <simpara>In other words: if there are a number of system structures are dependent one on another and being updated simultaneously
			they also need to follow current-new scheme. Doing system structure modification on confirmation phase works only in case if the system structure
			is independent!</simpara>
		    <simpara>The previous NodeAdp implementation perfored the system mutation on update phase. But is also was wrong because the change of system structure
			affects the system states so affects the process of update depending states.</simpara>
		    <simpara>Another problem is that system data depends on system structure so it needs to be studied if system structure change affect system data confirmation.</simpara>
		</sect4>
		<sect4><title>Solution : to buffer the mutation</title>
		    <simpara>We can avoid the system mut dependency from system data by buffering the mut. With that approach NodeAdp updates and save mut on update phase and
			apply the buffered mut on confirm phase.</simpara>
		</sect4>
		<sect4 id="ds_dcs_ucs_cip_ib"><title>Solution: using inputs buffering instead of state data buffering.</title>
		    <simpara>Let's consider two dependent system that needs to be changed: S1 and S2 and let's try to change them.
			Actually the dependencies can be interpreted as dependencies on some parameters of system, but not on whole system.
			For instance S2 depends on P1(S1), ... Pn(S1)
			and vice versa. These parameters (i.e. data) are the inputs of transition S2_T performing S2 change. We can freeze these inputs on confirmation phase.
			In this case S2_T inputs will be stable during S2 update. </simpara>
		    <simpara>This inputs freeze scheme was considered earlier (fapws?) also for data but that time state data freeze was choose because it is more effective -
			if some state is connected to N inputs then inputs freeze approach needs N double buffering instead of just one for data freeze.</simpara>
		    <simpara>Actually this solution aleady attempted to be applied in the current DES controller implementation,
			ref dessdc.h::SdcIapb and dessdc.cpp::ASdc::confirm() -
			inputs are freezed (confirmed) before controller controlling action. However this implementation is wrong -
			if we consider two dependent systems S1 and S2 then
			the confirmation is performed one to another. This means that for instance S1 handle confirmation first then S2. S1 params (i.e. S2 inps) are freezed on
			S2 confirmation. So S2 will be updated with NEW (not current) S1 params.

		<simpara>On initial times of DES design there was the idea of how such systems can be controlled. The idea was that specific layer needs to be used.
		    This layer considers underlying layer (controlled) as a data (same manner as regular DES considers states simple data as a data).
		    This means that controlling layer defines controlled layer via some data
		    (it should be structured data and complex enough). In fact this data is the static description of the structure of the controlled layer.
		    In contrast of chromosome this description doesn't specify the system in "dynamic" manner (i.e. via the chromo - spec of changes the sytem)
		    but statically, as existed structure. There shall be the transitions that can manipulate with such definitions, for instance delete one 
		    branch in sytem hierarchy etc.</simpara>

		    Currently the mut is used to update system structure via Node DES adapter (NodeAdp). But this solution is not convenient - the mut is specific

		    Morover the system structure update via structure data finally uses mutation - we just don't have another way to change system structure.

		    However these two approach differs from usage point of view. With NodeAdp we need to form the sequence of mutations with complex transitions. System structure

		<simpara>
		    It is the common case that controlling DES is implemented right in controlled DES. We can intoduce specific agents - 
		    <xref linkend="gls_sdc"/> to simplify the control. This agent input on one hand form "query" to managed system so the query provides
			boolean result (for instance, for "Comp" controller that creates new comp there are inputs "Name", "Parent" that forms the query
			"Is there component of type "Parent" and name "Name"). Let's call the query result as "output" of controller.
			On another hand the inputs forms control action - "Comp" controller creates the component.
			Controller also contains special boolean input "Enable" that enables the contolling action.
			Such controller scheme allows to create the controlling DES more convenient. One controller output connects to another controller
			"Enable" input so DES-stype dependencies are simply established.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>The main idea of this approach is "distributed" nature of controlling : there can be complex controlling scheme that includes

		<simpara>
		    Another case is when controlled system is not direct owner of controller. The solution here can be collect the controllers in
		    special host DES where we can provide controllers with "environmental" access to controlled system. This "environmental" access can
		    be implemented as the link to managed system that (this link is "known" to controllers). If we need to support more comples use-cases
		    (for instance the main case of modnav - select managed sub-system via navigation thru given system) then we can create custorm host DES that updates this

		<simpara>Major benefit of SDC solution is that the controlling of target system can be performed from many points of the model. It is

	    <sect3 id="ds_dcs_sdc_acc"><title>One more note about using change on confirmed phase with buffering inputs on update phase.</title>
		<simpara>
		    There was a number of discussion regarding DES "movement" design. Ref
		    <xref linkend="ds_dcs_ucs_itr"/>
		    Normally we use two-phase scheme (update-confirm) for that:
		    we calculate new values of states on update phase (the transition inputs are freezed) and freeze the values on confirm phase.
		    There is another approach - to calculate new value on confirm phase.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>In case of <xref linkend="gls_dcs"/> the important point is that the update-confirm scheme used for state simple data is
		    not convenient for controlling where the "data" is the whole controlled system. Obviously it is not possible to keep two instances of
		    data - confirmed and updated.</simpara>
		<simpara>Note that currently even simple state update mechanism is optimized, ref <xref linkend="ds_desopt_ums"/> but with this optimization
		    there are still two data instances.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>Why we need two instances"? Actually it is not necessary. What we actually need is to keep freezed current data when we 
		    calculate new value. In case of <xref linkend="gls_dcs"/> we can freeze not whole current data (i.e. not whole managed system structure)
			but just parts of it that are required to calculate the change to managed system.
			This is more simple. In that case we can freeze data on controling system transitions inputs.
			It is already discussed in <xref linkend="ds_dcs_ucs_cip_ib"/>. So the current note is just highlighting of that solution.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    There were many doubts that the scheme described above (mutating controlled system on confirmation phase) is not complied with 
		    standard scheme used for simple DES.
		    But actually this approach fully conforms to the "classic" simple DES update-confirm. Simple DES prepares the change on update phase and applies
		    the change on confirm phase. Same is performed with the scheme described above: "prepare change" means prepare all inputs that required to
		    perform mutation, "apply change" means perform mutation.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>It was clarified that using combines scheme (true update-confirm for system data and mut on confirmation for system structure) has
		    the problem, ref <xref linkend="ds_dcs_ucs_cip"/>. But this problem can be avoided with approach <xref linkend="ds_dcs_sl_lsc"/>.

			was not introduced for such purpose as system controlling. Instead it is just to establish "trusted" relationship between agent owner and agent so the agent can play the

	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>
		    It is normal case in the system using controlling when the controlled system (i.e. system + adapter) depends on itlself implicitly. The example is
		    <xref linkend="ds_dcs_ord"/> - the system is mutated with transition that gets system itself (acually internal connections) as input.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>In contrast of typical DES there aren't explicit dependencies, e.g states that depends each other.</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    The question is how to understand if subsystem depends on another subsystem (or even on itself) if threre aren't explicit dependencies?
		    Let's look at the example
		    <xref linkend="ds_dcs_ord"/>: how to get known if controlled system (Root.Launcher) depends on itself via the mutating
			transition?

		    What if some SDC fails, lets say InsertSlot. In that case we will have the managed system messed: there will be created widget, new slot but the widget
		    will not be shown. It is clear that we need to consider all these 4 SDCs as the single controlling DES. It looks like the transaction in database

	    <sect3 id="ds_dcs_iui_itr"><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>Let's look at FAP3-VIS VertDrp for the primary use-case. In VertDrp there is subsystem that positions the CRPs. This subsystem gets the inputs of CRPs params "CrpPars".
		    Then the subs iterates thru the inputs and performs poistioning for each CRP. But what is CRP pars changed during the iteration? In that case we need to reset the iterator and
		    start the positioning process from scratch. The question is of how to get this CrpPars inputs update indication in "DES compatible" form that allows us to use it as
		    reset data.</simpara>
		<simpara>Even if the problems seems simple it is not. The first thinking is that we can use some DES level subsystem to form this indication basing solely on MDesInpObserver 
		    notifications. But this seems not reachable - the notification just indicates the updates so subsystem states re-calculates its value. I couldn't find the universal way of 
		    implementing the update DES indication using solely DES elements. The only solution I invented is getting data form the input and form the data change indication.
		    So to have universal method we need creating specific native agents to get the indication.</simpara>
		<simpara>So there are at least three approaches in creating such native agent: </simpara>

			    The cons of this approach (comparing with "State like agent" is that it can be used in cases where we need to form the change indication not just for 
			    the whole input data but form the component of the data (the component of tuple for instance). This case if quite often. For instance VertCRP forms pairs most left
			    position by iterating pairs params. The params is the tuple but the iterator checks the only one comp of the tuple - column pos.

	<sect2 id="ds_dee_ssi"><title>Double buffered input</title>
	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>The base DES desing states that we need to update the state value on Update phase and then actualize (confirm) it
		    on Confirm phase. But sometimes we can use another way for embedded solution. Let's consider tipical DES adapter (ref desadp.cpp):
		    the adapter embeds "Managed agent" (MAG) state. With standard desing we need to have adapter input "MagUri" that value points
		    to MAG relatively to MAG base and dedication state "MAG". Adaprer gets activated thru "MagUri" input notification (confirm phase)
		    and set "MAG" state as activated, then on Update phase form preliminary MAG value and then on next confirm phase actualize
		    the "MAG" value</simpara>
		<simpara>This scheme assumes two embedded entities (input and state) and native connections between them.</simpara>
		<simpara>Alternative option is to have double buffered input. In that case the "MagUri" input is fixed on confirmation phase.
		    On confirmation phase the adapter can just check if new MagUri is confirmed and apply it to MAG. The pros of this variant
		    is that state transition can be implemented in host that simplify the code.</simpara>
		<simpara>Note that local transition (ref <xref linkend="ds_dee_sac"/> is the alternative solution, probably more elegant (this

	    <sect3 id="ds_dee_ssi_vgd"><title>Solution as the variant of DES generic desing</title>
		<simpara>Let's look at "Dedicated states ..." solution from DES generic desing point of view. Currently the DES cycle is based on
		    calculate new states values in Update phase (states freezed), confirm states and notify deps on Confirm phase - states are double-buffered,
		    states are freezed on Update.</simpara>
		<simpara>But there was alternative desing, that we considered on earlier fap2 (or even fap1) projects. This desing is to freeze transitions
		    inputs instead of states: calculate new states values in Update phase (inputs freezed), confirm inputs and notify deps on Confirm phase - inputs are
		    double buffered, states are freezed on conirm phase.</simpara>
		<simpara>This "Double buffered input" solution follows exactly such approach. The problem here is that for double buff inp solution DES cycle is
		    inverted the question is of how to align the parts working with contradicted phases. This problem can be simply solved in case of 
		    "embedded" states - DES just can control Confirmation phase: update the double buff inputs on early stage of confirm phase (so freeze them) and
		    then do the standart Confirm processing.</simpara>

	<sect2 id="ds_dee_sac"><title>Sharing DES agent context to transitions.</title>
	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>It is common case when we decide to move some part of DES functionality into "internal" native desing because the transitions depends on
		    internal agent context. The example is fap3-vis widget: requisition states depends of font size but the transition depends on C++ font instance created
		    in the scope of the agent. The idea of how to solve this is to keep fap3 DES style topology but give the agent context to the transition.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3 id="ds_dee_sac_ait"><title>Solution: Exposing agent interface to transition.</title>
		<simpara>This solution is base of IFR. Currently owner in fap3 native hier provides local MUnit iface. This allows a transition to request
		    some iface from the owner (actually in case of DES agent the owned system will route the request to the agent). So we can introduce the generic
		    MDestContext interface that a transition can use for access to agent's resources. This iface IFR can provide access to the agent specifically
		    defined iface, in case of fap3-vis widget example is can be MWidgetContext that resolves all the dependencies from the agent for the transition.</simpara>

	    <sect3 id="ds_dee_sac_asp"><title>Solution: creating binded transition via agent's specific provider.</title>
		<simpara>The idea is to pass the context to the transition on transition contstruction phase. This can be done with using agent specific provider.
		    Currently it is possible for the agent to register it's own provider via env addProvider(). Such provider can create the transition and pass the context
		    pointer to transition instance on creation phase. It that case the agent just implements MProvider interface.</simpara>
		<simpara>The potential problem here is that adding the provider affects global behaviour. Can we improve Env providers mechanism to have "local" provider?
		    Yes, ref <xref linkend="ds_lps"/> for the design. </simpara>

	    <sect3 id="ds_dee_sac_taee"><title>Node: Embedded transition as the alternative of other DES embedded elements.</title>
		<simpara>
		    Let's again consider the use-case: fap3-vis widget (widget.h) needs to update embedded font instance depending on font path state. Initial
		    solution was to utilize Buffered input DES embedded element, ref
		    <xref linkend="ds_dee_ssi"/>. With this solution we need to add embedded elements
			support to widget agent (this is quite a lot of code). Alternative solution would be using local scope transition: we have state FontPath, state
			FontApplied and local scope transition "ApplyFont" that containts the agent content and updates (re-creates) the embedded font instance.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>The question here if this scheme provides better understanding of the system. From my view embedded elems still makes system better undertstanding.
		    this is because the transistion "hides" the actual context so it is hard to see that the transition changes the context of agent.</simpara>

    <sect1 id="ds_dctx"><title>[DS_DCTX] DES context for components</title>
	<sect2><title>Intro</title>
	    <simpara>It is abundant use-case where some DES needs to share some context for its components. The example is fap3-vis Detail Representation (DRP). DRP
		creates a number of compact representations (CRP) to visualize represented agent's components. Each CRP needs info of the component it is representing: link to the whole
		model and component's URI related to this model. This info can be provided to CRP via connections but it creates significant overhead.</simpara>
	    <simpara>So the idea is to create the mechanism that can be used to establish such connection "automatically" OR even allow (in our example) CRP to get access to DRPs 
		states containing this info (this creates actually "virtual" connection that does't require such resources as explicit connection.</simpara>
	    <simpara>This feature requirements can vary. At the moment we can limit them by just sharing a socket. So the feature in that case looks like as:
		DRP has "shared" socket, CRP creates compatible socket in it's scope. Crp can use this interal socket as if the socket is connected to DRP socket via
		"virtual" connection.</simpara>
	    <simpara>Actually there is two approaches of creating such "virtual" connection. Approach#1 is to esablish native connection (via native conn).
		Approach#2 is to not establish explicit native connection but use some intermediate ifaces to get access to Provided and Required ifaces, ifaces in that case
		are not persistent but accessible via intermediate ifaces. Actually the intermediate "helper" ifaces are needed even for Approach#1 to establish persistent

			Let's at the moment keep the simplest use-case: consumer resolves the supplier basing on single paremeter. The paremeter can be supplier ID, or given

	<sect2><title>Intro</title>
	    <simpara>Current desing weakness is exposed by the use-case: how to simply check MDtBase IsValid() parameter. This parameter is the base one, i.e. not
		specific for type of data. It happens that it is not possible to get data base parameter in simply manner. Ref dest.h TrIsValid.</simpara>
	    <simpara>Currently the data ifaces are MDVarGet and parametrized MDtGet plus similar ifaces for setting data. All data related features are based on this
		parametrized data ifaces. This data parametrized iface approach causes a lot of related solutions. For instance there are paremetrized functions so 
		transitions just dynamically creates the function that matches output and input data types.</simpara>
	    <simpara>This approach was originated on earlier FAP design where is was assumed that any data types are allowed in the model. But then the
		idea of universal data was introduced, ref MDataBase iface. This approach allows to get rid of parametrized data at least for the model parts relation.
		But parametrized data was remain. We need to redesign the data ifaces to support universal data iface. This can vastly simplify DES framework.</simpara>

	<sect2><title>Solution_1: Keep MDVarGet but use non-paremetrized MDget iface instead of paremetrized MDtGet. </title>
	    <simpara>Pros: This solution allows smooth migration from templated iface. We just can redesing DES framework part by part.</simpara>

			With this method it is possible both resolving the suitable data getter and obtain the data.

		<simpara>Cons if this approach is that MDVarGet implementation shall cast data instance from MDtBase to particular data type

		are connected. The example is FAP3-VIS vertex DRP where DRP has context connpoint to what all CRPs are connected. DRP needs to react (create ordering) on all CRPs
		data - DRP has ordering subsystem that needs to order all CRPs connected. The naive "direct" solution would be to have separate ordering DRP subsystem for

	    <simpara>The demultiplexor has input resolving the number of ifaces and output that connects to "demultiplexed" subsystem input.

		<simpara>Many transition data "receivers" just copied data from its inputs and then use it. We need to avoid copying data but use refs instead.</simpara>
		<simpara>Hm. This copying seems the correct in general - function creates new data (result) and copy it to "receiver". The only problem here is that function
		    copy the result also to internal debugging data. This needs to be redesigned. Also getting the reference can be more optimal in the cases when the 
		    receiver doens't need the whole data but just parts of it. The example is the tuple component selector (TrTupleSel) or Vector element selector (TrAtVar). Currently
		    the selector transition copied the whole container and then gets the component of it. This is not optimal.</simpara>
		<simpara>The problem with getting refence is that we will need to cache the data in transitions - indeed we can get the ref to the persistent data only.
		    For the case of state as data getter it is simple, the state keeps persistent data.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Where to cache data in transtions: inputs or outputs?</title>
		<simpara>As was discussed in intro we anycase need to cache the data. The only questions in what point? There are two options: cache inputs data or 
		    cache output data.</simpara>
		<simpara>It is quite obvious that the inputs number is greater than the number of outputs. In "internals" of transition tree inputs number is greater 
		    because one output can be connected to the number of inputs but normally the numbers are same. But there are also "inputs" of transition tree - those
		    tranisition inputs that connect to states outputs. They make the inputs total number greater.</simpara>
		<simpara>So it makes sense to cache output data in transition.</simpara>
		<simpara>In that case we can also optimize the state - we don't need "updated" data anymore - the data is already cached in the transition connected to
		    state input.</simpara>
		<simpara>With this approach we needs to modify data getter iface (MDtGet) - it needs to return reference instead of perform the copy of data.</simpara>
	    </sect3>

		    on confirm phase this ref can change or cannot, it depends on what state confirm gets done first.</simpara>
		<simpara>This use-case shows that "using ouput data reference" approach is not correct.</simpara>
		<simpara>Potentially we can keep this approach with disabling such state-to-state connection. However this solution is very hard to

	<sect2><title>Solution</title>
	    <simpara>
		Current implementation already does MDtGet calls redirection. The only MDesInpObserver call is not redirected.
		Created new agent TrSwitchBool2. Added MDesInpObserver call redirection. Tested on fap3-vis ut_avr_vert_drp_2 -
		there is no performance valuable improvement. This weak affect to the performance can be explained: transitions cache (

    <sect1 id="ds_rdr"><title>Row data redesign.</title>
	<sect2 id="ds_rdr_itr"><title>Intro</title>
	    <simpara>The current implementation of row data has a number of problems that are indicated by use-cases below</simpara>
	    <sect3><title>Hierarchical composite data: serialization instead of direct parsing.</title>
		<simpara>The current design of row data is not consistent enough.</simpara>
		<simpara>The first problem is the composite data inconsistent text representation.
		    The use-case that expose the design problem is the container "Vector of Pair of string", signature "VPS",
		    ref rdata.cpp. The problem here is at least in the data deserialization from the text representation. It is assumed in the current design that the textual representation
		    of composite data is rather simple: just peace of text separated by space. This doesn't work for the composite data whose component is also composite data,
		    for instance Vector of Pairs.</simpara>
		<simpara>So, we need to re-design row-data at least in point of serialization/deserialization. We need to use subsequentual serialization from/to stream instead
		    of direct parsting of string.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Scalar data of string</title>
		<simpara>Migrating to serialization affects scalar data of string: now we need to understand where are the start and end of the string, i.e. string representation
		    syntax needs to include string delimiters.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3 id="ds_rdr_itr_ovst"><title>Overhead in Containers size transition.</title>
		<simpara>Look at TrSizeVar. Here we don't actually need to know what is the type of Vectors element. We simply need to get the size of Vector. But with the 
		    current design we need to exactly resolve the full type of Vector, i.e. have a number Vector variants supported.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3 id="ds_rdr_itr_senl"><title>Data text represenation syntax error is not logged</title>
		<simpara>The root-cause is that row-data has only one mValid flag that covers both undefined data and the data that gets erroneous because of wrong text representation.</simpara>
		<simpara>The solution would be have separate flags for these two cases.</simpara>

		<simpara>There should be dedicated servicing subsystem created for each client. Let's consider the simple servicing scheme.</simpara>
		<simpara>There are Servicing system SS, service connpoint CP with simplem interface (one inp Inp and one outp Outp),
		    clients A and B, and servicing subsystem SSS that "gets" the inp, gets SS context, and updates clients via CP output.</simpara>

	    <sect3 id="ds_ssp_dip_sss"><title>Can we have single updating (servicing) subsystem for clients?</title>
		<simpara>Note, that having single servicing subsystem makes sense only for the subsystem in form of transition, i.e. without any
		    states. If there are some states in subsystem there have to be separate subsystems.</simpara>
		<simpara>Yes, potentially such design can be used. But in that case we need to have enhanced interface resolution mechanism. Let's
		    consider same simple 2-clients schema:</simpara>
		<programlisting>
		    |        |-----------|
		    |   A---|  | SS      |
		    |       |CP|---|SSS| |     
		    |   B---|  |         |

		</programlisting>
		<simpara>There are Servicing system SS, service connpoint CP with simplem interface (one inp Inp and one outp Outp),
		    clients A and B, and servicing subsystem SSS that "gets" the inp, gets SS context, and updates clients via CP output.</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    When client A gets updated, it sends DES input update notification (MDesInpObserver) thru CP Inp. SSS should pass this
		    notif back to A thru CP Outp. When B get updated SSS should pass inp update notif back to B. So CP shall resolve MDesInpObserver
		    depending on iface resolution context, i.e. on what client makes the request.
		    Yes, CP Iface resolution rules can use iface resolution requestor. But the problem here is
		    that MDesInpObserver iface resolution request coming to CP doens't contain the full context - even each transition "breaks" the request context.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Current iface resolutin mechanism supports only context in form of requestor chain. But it is not enough in our case. We needs to have the 
		    context that can be somehow passed to the agent where it can be actually used. In our case for instance it will be the MDesInpObserver request
		    to CP. So we need to have the enhanced iface resoution mechanism to support single servicing subsystem schema. With the current resolution
		    mechanism the solution will not work. Ref <xref linkend="ds_irm_ctx"/> for IFR design materials.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>Potentially the solution would be keeping the request context in CP. For instance client A requests CP for MDVarGet, CP stores 
		    the request context (client A) and uses this context when servicing subsystem in turn requests CP for MDVarGet iface - CP will redirect the request to
		    client A.</simpara>

	    <sect3><title>Intro</title>
		<simpara>Ver next to 3ebc09ad1022d85</simpara>
		<simpara>
		    Created fap3/modules/dutil.chs. Tested with test/ut_des.cpp:ut_des_utl_1.chs. Observed the problem that BChange DES doesn't confirm even Delay state updated from false to true.
		    Analyzed. The root-cause is that Delay state content is set on creation phase - state notifies thru incomplete owning chain (so didn't reach the launcher) but the flag 
		    mUpdated was set, that prevent complete owning chain notifying on the first update.
		</simpara>
		<simpara>Curren solution is Solution#2, ref below.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Solution#1: avoid setting state mPdata and mCdata on content change.</title>
		<simpara>With this solution State doesn't change its datas immediately on content change but just keeps content and change mPdata on update phase from content kept.</simpara>
		<simpara>This solution doesn't work properly. The reason is that in the first init the constant state are undefined. This causes to dependent states gets undefined that
		    in turn causes the whole DES stop. Shortly saying we don't have initial conditions set for DES actually.</simpara>
	    </sect3>
	    <sect3><title>Solution#2: activate owned on owned attached</title>
		<simpara> The idea is to force owned active when attaching it to owner. There are variations of this solution.  </simpara>
		<simpara> The Var#1 is rather "brutal" - just to activate the owner unconditionally.  </simpara>
		<simpara> The Var#2 is to activate only if the owned was already activated. We need to add methods "isActivated" and "isUpdated" to MDesSyncable in this case.</simpara>

		    Current parent resolution mechanism doesn't work here. The mutation is as:
		    <programlisting>
			364		parent = getParent(prnturi);
			(gdb) p Uid()
			$12 = ".testroot.Test.Window.Scene.Drp%MOwned"
			(gdb) p mContext->Uid()
			$13 = ".testroot.Modules.AvrMdl2%MOwner"
		    </programlisting>
			The mechanism is pritty simple (func getParent):
		    <programlisting>
			- look up in local scope (mutation scope) using getNode()
			- redirect to owner's getParent()
			- look up in modules using modules->getNode()
		    </programlisting>
			note that mContext of ".testroot.Modules.AvrMdl2%MOwner" ecuals 0. So the look up trace is as:
		    <programlisting>
			.testroot.Test.Window.Scene.Drp
			.testroot.Modules.AvrMdl2
			.testroot.Modules (owenr of AvrMdl2 as AvrMdl2 doesn't have a context).
			.testroot.Test.Window.Scene
			...
			fail
		    </programlisting>
		</simpara>
		<simpara>Hmm, but such resolution works in modnav2. Right, in modnav2 the slot is created from </simpara>
		<programlisting>.testroot.Launcher.Window.Scene.VBox.ModelView.Drp</programlisting>
		<simpara>
		    So the look up trace is as:
		    <programlisting>
			.testroot.Launcher.Window.Scene.VBox.ModelView.Drp
			.testroot.Modules.AvrMdl2
			.testroot.Modules (owner of AvrMdl2 as AvrMdl2 doesn't have a context).
			.testroot.Launcher.Window.Scene.VBox.ModelView
			(context) Modules.ContainerMod
			...
			ok
		    </programlisting>
			The resolution is ok, but this result is just "accidental", because the "right" owner of Drp.

		<simpara>
		    Real root-cause is that the ContainerMod module desing is wrong:

			...
			325         SlotParent &lt; = "SS FHLayoutSlot";

			SlotParent paremeter is set here incorrectly. It should be set from the real context where it is used, i.e. from the test system

	    </sect2>
	    <sect2><title>Analysis</title>
		<simpara>The problem's root-cause is that IRM creates a massive amount of routing pathes for MDesInpObserver iface. This makes the IRM data update very slow,
		    especially when the nodes invalidate its IRM nodes. Additional mechamisms like <xref linkend="gls_asr"/> exacerbates the problem.</simpara>
		<simpara>The trigger of emerging of this problem is the VIS container update to handle button press event. This update assumes adding
		    to the socket the transitions that sequentially (this is container socket philosophy) forms the right URI of pressed widget. But this new transition
		    creates very complex structure for IRM because the transition are not just chain but each node of the chain creates the nomber of IRM pathes. To
		    the overall number of IRM pathes grows dramatically (some thousands for instance).</simpara>
		<simpara>Simplifying of the new transitions and reducing the number of IRM pathes partially helps, but the app creating is still slow.</simpara>
